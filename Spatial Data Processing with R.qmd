## Preparation

In order to run the code for this workshop, you'll need the following packages. You can use the following code to install them. All the required dependencies will be automatically installed.

::: callout-important
Please also update to the latest version of R, otherwise you may get packages that are not fully up-to-date.
:::

``` r
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("lwgeom")
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("spatstat.random")
install.packages("spdep")
install.packages("tmap")
install.packages("tmaptools")
install.packages("mapview")
```

The data you'll need for the workshop is available on the GitHub repository (<https://github.com/jguelat/R-GIS>). You'll also find all the code needed to re-create this document.

## Introduction

When we work with geographic data we need to decide how to model real world objects or concepts (buildings, forests, elevation, etc.) before we can use them in a computer with a GIS (Geographic Information System) software. GIS people mainly use 2 main data models: vector and raster. Other models exist, such as TINs, point clouds or meshes, but we won't cover them in this workshop.

Vector data is normally used for high precision data sets and can be represented as points, lines or polygons. Properties of the represented features are stored as attributes. The vector types you will use depends of course on your own data and on your analyses. For example: points could be appropriate for bird nests and sightings, lines for moving animals and linear structures (paths, rivers), and polygons for territories and land cover categories. Of course a river can also be modeled as a polygon if you're interested in its width (or you can also store its width as an attribute of the line).

::: callout-note
High precision doesn't necessarily mean high accuracy! For example the coordinates of some points could be stored in meters with 5 decimals even though the measurement error was 2 meters.

Most vector data formats include some possibility to store information about measurement errors but this is actually very rarely used.
:::

The best known format for storing vector data is the shapefile, an old and inefficient format developed by ESRI. Even though the shapefile format is still widely used, it has a lot of limitations and problems (listed on the following website: <http://switchfromshapefile.org>). Nowadays GIS specialists advise to replace it with better alternatives such as the **GeoPackage** format. Every modern GIS software can read and write GeoPackages and the format is also completely open-source. It is also published as a standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) which makes it a future-proof alternative.

Raster data is basically an image divided into cells (pixels) of constant size, and each cell has an associated value. Satellite imagery, topographic maps and digital elevation models (DEM) are typical examples where the raster data model is appropriate. A raster data set can have several layers called bands, for example most aerial images have at least three bands: red, green and blue. In the raster data model, specific geographic features are aggregated to a given resolution to create a consistent data set, associated with a loss of precision. The resolution used to aggregate can have a large influence of some analyses and must be thought of carefully.

There exists thousands of different raster data formats. As of today I recommend using the **GeoTiff** format. It is widely used in the GIS world and every GIS software can read and write raster data in this format. Note that it is also possible to use the GeoPackage format to save raster data sets, however I would advise against using it since some GIS software won't be able to read these rasters.

## Vector data

### Vector data model

The main vector types are points, lines and polygons (or a combination thereof) and the point is the base of all these types. For example a simple line consists of 2 connected points, similarly an ordered sequence of connected points will represent a more complex line (often called a polyline). A simple polygon will be modeled as an external ring, which is a special type of polyline where the first and last points are identical. In the case of lines and polygons we often speak of vertices to describe these points. Things can be a bit more complex, for example a polygon could have a hole which is modeled as an internal ring.

The **Simple Feature** standard ([full documentation](https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=25355)) was developed to be sure that we all speak the same language when describing vector elements. The specification describes 18 geometry types, but don't worry only 7 of them will be useful for us. The following figure shows these 7 types (source: Lovelace *et al.*, 2019):

![](figures/sf-classes.png)

A feature represents a geographic entity modeled by one of these types. For example a building would be a single feature of type POLYGON, while the whole Hawaii archipelago would be a single feature of type MULTIPOLYGON (but you could of course also model each island as type POLYGON). A single feature using the MULTI\* types can have multiple elements but this is not mandatory. Most of the time we will use the default 2D version of these types. However it is possible to include additional numeric values such as the height of each point (Z values) or some kind of measurement error (M values). Note that most GIS software will ignore these values for the vast majority of spatial analyses.

::: callout-important
The feature type is usually defined for the whole vector data set, and not per feature (well actually `sf` lets you do that but this will brings you all sorts of troubles). For example, if you know that your data set will contain POLYGON and MULTIPOLYGON features, then you will have to use the MULTIPOLYGON type for all of them.
:::

In most GIS softwares (including R), simple features are internally encoded using the well-known binary (WKB) or well-known text (WKT) standards. As the name mentions, WKB is a binary format and hence not easily readable by normal humans. The WKT format is encoding exactly the same information as WKB, but in a more human friendly way. Here are some examples of WKT-encoded features (check the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) if you need more):

-   a point: POINT (10 5)
-   a linestring made of 3 points: LINESTRING (1 1, 2 4, 5 10)
-   a polygon (without a hole): POLYGON ((10 5, 10 9, 5 8, 4 2, 10 5))
-   a multilinestring: MULTILINESTRING ((1 1, 2 4, 5 10), (2 2, 5 2))

The geometry is of course essential in order to have a spatial information but the vector data model also allows storing non-spatial attributes (often called *attribute table*) for each feature. As we will see, these tables are stored as data frames in R and each column will store some property of the related feature (identification number, name, etc.). Each row relates to a single spatial feature (which can consist of several geometries if its type is MULTI\*). The following figure shows some examples (source: Tennekes & Nowosad, 2021):

![](figures/vector-data-model-1.png){width="600"}

### A first look at vector data in R

Let's have a look at how R stores a vector data set. The main classes and methods needed to work with spatial vector data are defined in the `sf` package (Pebesma, 2018). We will also load the `tmap` package (Tennekes, 2018) to have access to some spatial data sets.

```{r}
library(tmap)
library(sf)
```

When you first load the `sf` package, it will provide you with version information about some important open-source GIS libraries it uses. In a few rare cases, some functions will only be available if you use recent version of these libraries. If you use `sf` on Windows or Mac and install it from CRAN, they will be included inside the `sf` package and there's no easy way to update them. These libraries are used in almost all open-source GIS software and even in some commercial ones. GDAL takes care of reading and writing your GIS files and can read 99.9% of all the existing GIS formats; GEOS is a Euclidean planar geometry engine and is used for all the common GIS analyses (intersection, union, buffer, etc.); PROJ is responsible for all the coordinate reference systems operations. The s2 library is a spherical geometry engine which is active by default for computations when using unprojected data.

::: callout-important
## A bit of history

The availability of the `sf` package was huge change in the small world of "R-Spatial". In the old days we used a combination of several packages to process GIS vector data in R. The spatial classes (and some functions) were defined in the `sp` package, the import/export of data was managed by the `rgdal` package, and the geometric operations were available in the `rgeos` package. You'll find a lot of code using these packages on the internet. Please refrain from using them since they'll only be maintained until end of 2023 and will then probably be removed from CRAN. Moreover the `sf` package is definitely more powerful and much faster.
:::

We will now load the `World` vector data set inside the `tmap` package and have a look at its structure.

```{r}
data(World)
class(World)
names(World)
World
```

We see the `World` object is stored as a data frame with an additional geometry column (note that the name of the geometry column doesn't need to be 'geometry'). The content of the geometry column is displayed using the WKT standard. R is also giving us more information, like the coordinate reference system used (more on that later) and the number of dimensions (i.e. XY, XYZ or XYZM).

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" icon="false"}
## Question: why is the MULTIPOLYGON type appropriate?

Don't forget that each feature (i.e. each row of the data frame) represents a country, and some countries are made up of several distinct pieces of land (e.g., islands, exclaves). That's why we need the MULTIPOLYGON type. And since the type apply to the whole data set, even countries with a single geometry (like Switzerland) will need to be MULTIPOLYGONS.
:::

It is also easy to plot the data using the usual command.

```{r}
#| warning: false
plot(World)
```

By default R will take the first 9 attributes of the `sf` object and plot them using the available geometries. Since these objects inherit from the data base class, you can use all the typical data frame functions such as `summary`, `head`, `merge`, `rbind`, etc. Subsetting is also possible using the standard `[]` operators. Therefore you can use the following code if you only want to plot the well-being index, for the whole world, only for countries with a high index, or just for Australia.

```{r}
plot(World[,"well_being"])
plot(World[which(World$well_being > 6),"well_being"])
plot(World[which(World$name == "Australia"),"well_being"])
```

Note that the color scale was adapted depending on the available values in the filtered data set. If you only need the geometries without any attributes, then you can use the `st_geometry()` function.

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(World))
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Play a little bit with the `World` data set, try different functions that you would normally use with a data frame. Import the `redlist` data set in the file `red_list_index.csv` (source: <https://stats.oecd.org>) and join it to the `World` data frame to add new attributes. Plot a world map using one of the new attributes.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
redlist <- read.csv("data/red_list_index.csv")
world2 <- merge(World, redlist, by.x = "iso_a3", by.y = "code")
plot(world2[,"index_2020"])
```
:::

### Structure of `sf` objects

Most of the time you won't need to create your own `sf` objects from scratch since you'll import some existing GIS data. But if you need to, there are special functions to help you. This is also a good way to get a better understanding of the structure of `sf` objects. The standard process is shown in the following figure (source: Lovelace *et al.*, 2019):

![](figures/02-sfdiagram.png){width="800"}

You first need to create each feature geometry using some constructor functions. Each of these features will be of class `sfg` (simple feature geometry). Then you collect all these geometries in a list using the `st_sfc()` function. You get a new object of class `sfc` (simple feature list-column). After that you combine the newly created simple feature list-column with the attributes (stored as a data frame, or a tibble) using the `st_sf()` function in order to get an `sf` object.

Since this is rather abstract, let's look at a simple example. Imagine we want to create a point data set containing three bird observations, and each observation will have the following attributes: species and sex. We start by creating our point geometries:

```{r}
pt1 <- st_point(c(2657000, 1219000))
pt2 <- st_point(c(2658000, 1218000))
pt3 <- st_point(c(2659000, 1217000))
```

Let's have a look at what we've just created:

```{r}
pt1
class(pt1)
typeof(pt1)
str(pt1)
```

Our first object is a 2D point (otherwise we would see XYZ or XYZM) of class `sfg`. If we look a bit more into the details of the structure, we see that it is actually stored as vector of type `double` (with length 2).

Now we need to collect our points inside an `sfc` object. This is simply a list of `sfg` objects with an associated coordinate reference system (CRS). Since we collected our data in Switzerland, we will use the standard Swiss coordinate reference system. As we will see later, most coordinate reference systems are identified by a specific number.

```{r}
pts <- st_sfc(pt1, pt2, pt3, crs = "EPSG:2056")
```

Let's have a look at our new creation:

```{r}
pts
class(pts)
typeof(pts)
str(pts)
```

This confirms that our `sfc` object is actually a list, and this object will be the geometry column of the soon to be created `sf` object. Since our object is a list, it is easy to extract individual elements if needed:

```{r}
# Extract the second item of the list
pts[[2]]
class(pts[[2]])
```

The feature geometries are defined and stored in an `sfc` object, now we just need to define the attributes of each feature. We store them in a data frame using the same order as the geometries.

```{r}
pts_data <- data.frame(species = c("wallcreeper", "alpine chough", "kingfisher"),
                       sex = c("male", "female", "female"))
pts_data
```

And as a last step we combine the feature geometries with the related attributes using the `st_sf()` function. We now have a typical GIS data set stored as an `sf` object.

```{r}
pts_sf <- st_sf(pts_data, geometry = pts)
pts_sf
```

Since everything is stored as lists, it is again easy to access individual elements of the `sf` object:

```{r}
# Extract the 3rd geometry
pts_sf$geometry[[3]]
```

We process similarly to create other geometry types from scratch, the only difference is that we now need matrices to store the vertices of the lines and polygons instead of a simple vector, and for multilinestrings, (multi-)polygons and geometry collections, we need more lists to encapsulate everything. If you're not sure how to create geometries, the `sf` documentation provides examples for all the geometry types. Look for the following functions: `st_point()`, `st_linestring()`, `st_polygon()`, `st_multipoint()`, `st_multilinestring()`, `st_multipolygon()`, `st_geometrycollection()`. Here's a more complex example showing how to create a multipolygon (including one geometry with a hole) inside a `sfg` object. The next steps (collecting geometries in a `sfc` object, adding attributes and store as a `sf` object) are exactly the same as before.

```{r}
# rbind creates matrices and makes the coding easier
pol1_border <- rbind(c(1, 5), c(2, 2), c(4, 1), c(4, 4), c(1, 5))
pol1_hole <- rbind(c(2, 4), c(3, 4), c(3, 3), c(2, 3), c(2, 4))
pol1 <- list(pol1_border, pol1_hole)
pol2 <- list(rbind(c(0, 2), c(1, 2), c(1, 3), c(0, 3), c(0, 2)))
multipolygon_list <- list(pol1, pol2)
multipol <- st_multipolygon(multipolygon_list)
multipol
plot(multipol, col = "navy")
```

## Exercise (5 minutes)

Try to build your own `sfc` and `sf` objects.

## Raster data

As we saw above, a raster data set is basically an image, which is the same as a grid of pixels. Most raster data sets you will encounter will have a constant pixel size (also called resolution) and we will only focus on these during this workshop. However don't forget that other kind of grids, for example sheared or curvilinear, also exist. This is sometimes needed depending on the coordinate reference system used to store the data, or can be caused by some reprojections.

Rasters are perfect for storing continuous values contained in a large area (called the extent of the raster). Digital elevation models are a typical example of such data, each cell is used to store an elevation value. You will also find rasters containing discrete values, these are often used to store landcover or landuse data sets. Note that, unlike vector data, it is impossible to store overlapping features in the same data set. We saw that vector data sets can store multiple attributes for a single feature. We can use a similar technique for raster data sets with the help of raster bands. You can think of raster bands as different layers of the same grid, each layer containing a different information. This is mainly use for spectral data, for example the red, green and blue intensity values in an aerial picture; satellite imagery will have even more bands depending on the number of sensors. Multiband rasters are also often used to store environment variables that change through time (e.g. a temperature raster, with one band per day). Such rasters are often called datacubes.

![](figures/raster_types.jpg)

Performing computations on raster data sets is usually very efficient and faster than using vector data, this is due to the fact that rasters are stored in some kind of matrix formats with some extra information (such as the coordinate reference system and the origin of the raster). It this thus possible to use highly efficient linear algebra libraries. The mathematical operations performed on raster cells are called map algebra.

For this workshop we will use the `terra` package to work with raster data. This package has everything needed to import, analyses, visualize and export raster data sets. Like the `sf` package, it is also using the GDAL library for the import/export operations, which means it can open almost every raster data format. Unlike the `sf` package, `terra` will not import the full data sets in memory but only create a pointer to the data and then read smaller blocks of data successively. This allows working with very large rasters with a relatively small memory footprint. The amount of functions available in the `terra` package is similar to typical GIS software.

::: callout-important
## Rasters and R workspaces

Since `terra` only stores a pointer to the raster data set, this means the actual data set won't be included if you save your session in an R workspace (.Rdata files). If you really want to include it in your workspace, you can use the `wrap()` function. Note that this is also needed if you want to pass raster data over a connection that serializes, e.g. to a computer cluster.
:::

There is another famous R package to process raster data, the `stars` package. It is especially useful if you need to work with "irregular" rasters (sheared, curvilinear, etc.) or with complex datacubes. It is also tidyverse-friendly and the syntax is closed to the one use in `sf`. However the number of available functions is (still) much lower than in `terra`. If you need to use both packages, it is fortunately easy to convert raster objects from `terra` to `stars` (using the function `st_as_stars()`), and the other way round (using the function `rast()`).

::: callout-note
## A bit of history

A revolution happened in 2010 in the small world of R-Spatial when the `raster` package was released. People were able to perform analyses using raster data sets in R instead of using a standard GIS software. The package has been maintained during many years, and many functions were added. However its developer decided to create a new package from scratch in order to improve speed and memory efficiency, the `terra` package was born. You will often find a lot of R code using the `raster` package on the web. Fortunately it is quite easy to adapt code written for the `raster` package to `terra`. The functions have similar names (sometimes even identical) and everything that was available in `raster` should also be available in `terra`. Actually the recent versions of `raster` even use `terra` in the background instead of the original `raster` code.
:::

## Coordinate reference systems

The majority of normal people will get scared if there's some problem to solve involving coordinate reference systems or projections. That's why I will keep this part really short and only show you the stuff you will need to perform standard GIS analyses with R. If you want to read more about this (extremely interesting) topic, I invite to read the following book chapters: <https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/spatial-class.html#crs-intro> and <https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap-book/geodata.html#crs>.

There is a famous expression saying "spatial is special"... One of the main reasons is that such data will have an associated location and you thus need to a reference frame to describe this location. This reference frame is called a coordinate reference system (CRS) in the GIS world. CRSs can be either geographic or projected.

::: callout-important
When you're working with GIS data, you should always know the CRS you're using. Otherwise coordinates are just numbers without a reference frame. When you share GIS data, make sure the CRS is always defined in the data set or documented in some other way. The CRS of a vector data set can be queried with the `st_crs()` function, for a terra object you should use the `crs()` function.
:::

A geographic CRS will identify locations on a spheroid or an ellipsoid using 2 values: latitude and longitude. The shape of the Earth is actually a geoid, but it is too complex to perform computations and thus one has to use approximations. The spheroid is making the assumptions that the Earth is a sphere, while the ellipsoid is a better approximation accounting for the fact that our planet is a bit compressed. Geographic coordinate systems are not using a projection! All the computations (distances, buffers, etc.) have to happen on the spheroid/ellipsoid which makes things more complex. It is easy to make mistakes when working with geographic CRSs, and even smart people fell in this trap (e.g. <https://georeferenced.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/worldmapblunders>).

Projected CRSs are based on geographic CRSs but include an additional projection step on a flat surface. When using a projected CRS, locations are described using Cartesian coordinates called easting and northing (x and y). Projecting a spherical or ellipsoidal surface on a plane will cause deformations. These will affect four properties of the surface: areas, distances, shapes and directions. A projected CRS can preserve only one or two of these properties. There exists a ton of different projections and all of them make different compromises, some are even totally useless (check this beautiful xkcd comic: <https://xkcd.com/977>). Choosing a projection can be challenging, especially if your data covers a very large area. The following websites allow you to visualize the main projection types: <https://www.geo-projections.com> and <https://map-projections.net/singleview.php>. The second website also provides a nice tool to visualize distortions called a Tissot indicatrix. Fortunately, if your data is within a "smallish" area, it is relatively easy to find a good projected CRS that has only minimal distortions. Almost every country has its own recommended projected CRS (or CRSs), and if your data covers several countries, you can use some UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinate systems.

::: callout-tip
It is almost always easier to work with a projected CRS, except if your data is really global (or covering a really large area, like a continent). Moreover, most GIS software will (still) make the assumption that you're data is on a flat plane, even if you're working with a geographic CRS. The `sf` package is kind of an exception since it will actually perform calculations on a spheroid if you use a geographic CRS, thanks to the s2 library.
:::

::: callout-important
The CRS used by almost all mapping websites (OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, etc.) should never be used for any analysis. It is a slightly modified version of the Mercator projection called Web Mercator or Pseudo-Mercator. It has some advantages allowing good visualization speed, but the distortions are massive. Check the following website: <https://www.thetruesize.com>.
:::

With so many CRSs available, we need a way to classify them. That's what the EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) started doing a few years ago. They collected and documented most available CRSs in a data set which is now called the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset (<https://epsg.org/home.html>). In this data set, every CRS has a unique identification number that can be used in a GIS software instead of writing the full definition of the CRS. The best available transformations between CRSs are also defined. Sadly this data set is still missing a few interesting CRSs and was thus completed by other companies such as ESRI. This is the reason why you'll sometimes see ESRI codes instead of EPSG for some CRSs. The following CRSs are the most important for us:

| Code | Name | Description |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| 2056 (EPSG) | CH1903+/LV95 | Projected CRS currently used in Switzerland |
| 21781 (EPSG) | CH1903/LV03 | Former projected CRS used in Switzerland, you will still find data sets using this one |
| 4326 (EPSG) | WGS84 | Geographic CRS used for most global data sets, and by GPS devices |
| 3857 (EPSG) | Pseudo-Mercator | Projected CRS used by online maps |
| 8857 (EPSG) | Equal Earth Greenwich | Nice equal-area projection for world maps |
| 54030 (ESRI) | Robinson | Aesthetically pleasing projection for world maps |

::: callout-important
## Proj4strings

When looking for examples on the web, you will often find code using what is called a proj4string to define a CRS or to reproject data. For example the proj4string for the current Swiss CRS looks like this: `+proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524055555556 +lon_0=7.43958333333333 +k_0=1 +x_0=2600000 +y_0=1200000 +ellps=bessel +towgs84=674.374,15.056,405.346,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs +type=crs`. This was the standard way of describing CRSs until a few years ago. You should NOT use these strings, instead always use the EPSG number to be on the safe side. Otherwise you may get small to medium position errors when reprojecting your data.
:::

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

You can easily inspect the way CRSs are stored in modern GIS software. For example if you want to inspect the current Swiss CRS, try `st_crs("EPSG:2056")`. You will get the full description of the CRS. Try to understand some of the elements. If you use EPSG codes, you can also simply enter the code as an integer, if it's an ESRI code you should use `st_crs("ESRI:xxxxx")` where `xxxxx` is the ESRI code.

## Tips and tricks for vectors

### Reading and writing vector data

We had a look at the gory details of the internal structure `sf` objects. However most of the time you will not create such objects on your own but rather rely on the `sf` package to create the right structure when you import existing GIS data. The `sf` package is using the GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) library to read and write GIS files, and this means you will be able to import almost all existing GIS vector formats. Note that the vector part of the GDAL library is often called OGR. Sometimes you will not get a standard GIS data set but a simple CSV (or Excel) file containing coordinates and related attributes. We will first see how to import these different data types in order to use them with the `sf` package, and then how to export `sf` objects in a standard GIS format.

#### Importing a GeoPackage

The GeoPackage format is the best available open format to store vector data. It is based on the SQLite database format which is probably one of the most used file-based database nowadays. You can think of it as a special folder containing one or several GIS data sets. Since we normally don't know in advance if a GeoPackage contains one or more data sets, we first have to inspect it.

```{r}
st_layers("data/geodata.gpkg")
```

You should not always trust the reported number of features. Some GIS format such as the GeoPackage report this number, some don't. If the GeoPackage was produced by a software that doesn't properly implement the standard, the reported number of features can be wrong (but this shouldn't have any other bad consequence). If you want to be sure to get the correct number, you can use the `do_count = TRUE` argument of the `st_layers()` function, but this will be slower.

To read the data, you use the `st_read()` function, the first argument is the path of the GeoPackage, and the second argument is the layer you want to import. The function will return a `sf` object. By default you'll get some information about the data being imported. If you don't need them, you can use the argument `quiet = TRUE`.

```{r}
muni <- st_read("data/geodata.gpkg", "municipalities")
streets <- st_read("data/geodata.gpkg", "streets", quiet = TRUE)
muni
```

We see some basic information about the data set, and the first features are shown as well with all the attributes. The municipalities data set in an extract of the swissBOUNDARIES3D provided by Swisstopo, the streets data set is an extract of the swissTLM3D also provided by Swisstopo.

#### Importing a Shapefile

If you really need to import a Shapefile, you can use the same function. Since Shapefiles cannot contain more than one data set, we only need to provide the first argument of the function. A Shapefile consists of several file with different extensions (.shp, .shx, etc.), we use the .shp extension by default when importing.

```{r}
muni2 <- st_read("data/municipalities.shp", quiet = TRUE)
muni2
```

This is actually the same data set as the one in the GeoPackage, however we seen that `sf` is now using polygons instead of multipolygons. This is caused by the fact that the Shapefile format does not distinguish properly between the two types. You can thus have a combination of polygons and multipolygons in the same data set.

#### Importing from a PostGIS database

PostGIS is a famous open-source extension for the PostgreSQL database management system. It allows storing all kind of GIS data inside a database and perform hundreds of typical GIS analyses. The Swiss Ornithological Institute is using PostGIS to store almost all its bird data and a lot of other GIS data sets. If you have a laptop provided by the institute and you have access to the institute internal network (via cable or private Wi-Fi, not the public one), you should be able to run the following code.

First we need to load the `RPostgres` package which provides function to access PostgreSQL databases (and hence PostGIS, too). There is another package providing similar functionality called `RPostgreSQL`, but in my opinion the `RPostgres` is better maintained and I experienced less problems.

After storing all the connection details in some variables, we can finally create a connection to the database using the `dbConnect()` function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(RPostgres)

# Login data
user <- "gast_vowa"
password <- scan("/Users/jguelat/Desktop/pass.txt", what = "character", quiet = TRUE)
host <- "dbspatialdata1"
database <- "research"

# Connection to the database
dbcon <- dbConnect(Postgres(), dbname = database, host = host, user = user, password = password)
```

After that we need to import the data with a query, using again the `st_read()` function. Note that the first argument of the function must be the database connection object. The first possibility consists of importing the whole layer (called table in the database lingo) with all its attributes. This is what we do for the `cantons1` data set. We need to use the `Id()` function to specify the location of the table inside the database. In a PostgreSQL database, a schema is a bit like a folder where we store tables, this allows us to implement some structure inside the database. In our case the table `cantonal_boundaries_ch` is stored inside the schema `perimeter`. Note that we don't need the `Id()` function if the table are stored in the `public` schema.

We can also specify a SQL query to import the data, like for the `cantons2` data set. Using this kind of query, we are fully flexible. We can for example specify the attributes we want to import, specific data filters, we can even join different tables together (by attributes or even spatially). Once again we have to specify the schema, but this is done a bit differently.

Once we have our `sf` objects, we still need to disconnect the database. The cantonal_boundaries_ch data set contains all the cantonal boundaries in Switzerland. The data is provided by Swisstopo (swissBOUNDARIES3D).

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Load cantonal boundaries
cantons1 <- st_read(dbcon, layer = Id(schema = "perimeter", table = "cantonal_boundaries_ch"))
cantons2 <- st_read(dbcon, query = "SELECT id, name, geom
                                    FROM perimeter.cantonal_boundaries_ch
                                    WHERE name = 'Fribourg'")

# Disconnect database
dbDisconnect(dbcon)

# Show sf objects
cantons1
cantons2
```

#### Importing a CSV file with coordinates

If you have a table containing coordinates of point data (e.g. sites or bird sightings), you should use the `st_as_sf()` function. The first argument should be the dataframe containing the data, and you also need to specify the names of the columns containing the geographic coordinates, and the CRS used. This data set was extracted from the bird sightings database of the Swiss Ornithological Institute.

```{r}
obs <- read.csv("data/observations.csv")
head(obs)

obs <- st_as_sf(obs, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = "EPSG:2056")
obs
```

#### Exporting to GeoPackage

To export vector data, you need to use the `st_write()` function. Like the `st_read()` function, it uses the GDAL library, so you'll be able to export in many different formats. You can specify the format explicitely, otherwise `sf` will try to guess it based on the file extension. For a GeoPackage, you need to specify the name of the GeoPackage first (it will be automatically created if it doesn't exist) and the name of the data set that will be stored inside the GeoPackage. If you specify a GeoPackage that already exists, the data set will be added to it as a new table.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
if(file.exists("export/birds.gpkg")) {file.remove("export/birds.gpkg")}
```

```{r}
st_write(obs, "export/birds.gpkg", "observations")

obs2 <- obs[1:10,]
st_write(obs2, "export/birds.gpkg", "observations2", quiet = TRUE)
st_layers("export/birds.gpkg")
```

If you want to delete a data set, you can use the `st_delete()` function. Think twice before doing it, there will be no warning!

```{r}
st_delete("export/birds.gpkg", "observations2")
```

#### Exporting to Shapefile

Please don't!

### Basic geometric computations

In this section we'll see how to perform some basic geometric computations on spatial data. For example let's how we can compute the area of polygons of the length of lines.

```{r}
st_area(muni)
head(st_length(streets))
```

Note that the results always have a unit of measurement. This is a feature that is provided by `sf` and will occur will all functions giving some sort of measurement. This is compatible with the `units` package which allows easy conversions between different unit types. However this can sometimes be a problem if you need a "raw" value. In this case you can use the `as.numeric()` function to remove the units.

For some strange reason, there is no function in `sf` to compute the perimeter of polygons. To do that you'll need the `st_perimeter()` function in the `lwgeom` package which gives access to some functions available in the PostGIS database.

```{r}
library(lwgeom)
st_perimeter(muni)
```

Computing the centroid of polygons is another useful operation that is easily computed using the `st_centroid()` function.

```{r}
muni_centroid <- st_centroid(muni)
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(st_geometry(muni_centroid), add = TRUE)
```

Sometimes we also need to know the coordinates of the `sf` objects we're using. For points we of course get the coordinates of the points, for lines and polygons we get the coordinates of the vertices, with additional columns showing how to reconstruct the features.

```{r}
st_coordinates(muni_centroid)
head(st_coordinates(muni))
```

Centroid can be used to place labels inside polygons, but don't forget that polygons with strange shapes may not contain their centroid. If for some reason you need to be sure to have the point inside the polygon, use the `st_point_on_surface()` function.

Unfortunately geometric computations are not always that easy... Let's have a look at another example. We load another polygon layer and try to compute the area of each polygon.

```{r}
temp <- st_read("data/geodata.gpkg", "wtf", quiet = TRUE)
plot(temp, col = 1:nrow(temp))
st_area(temp)
```

Oops, these polygons look big enough but one of them seems to have an area of 0... Why is this happening? We need to talk a bit about geometric validity...

### Geometric validity

When we had a look a the vector data model, we discovered the Simple Feature standard but we forgot an important part: geometric validity. Validity is defined a bit differently depending on the geometry engine used for the computations. First the good news: points are always valid! Lines are always valid for the GEOS engine used by `sf` but they are considered invalid by QGIS if they have self-intersections (such lines are called non-simple). Polygons are definitely invalid if they have self-intersections (like our example). The other invalid cases are shown on this website: <https://postgis.net/docs/using_postgis_dbmanagement.html#Valid_Geometry>. Using invalid geometries can be problematic for some analyses, such as computing areas.

Normally we should expect official data sets to be valid but this is often not the case. You can check the validity of each feature using the `st_is_valid()` function. If you want a short description of the problems, you can add the argument `reason = TRUE`.

```{r}
temp
st_is_valid(temp)
st_is_valid(temp, reason = TRUE)
```

If there are only a few invalid features, we can correct them manually in QGIS. But sometimes this is not feasible and we need some automatic way of correcting. This is where the `st_make_valid()` function shines. Even though it's fully automatic, it will perform the appropriate changes 99% of the time.

```{r}
temp_valid <- st_make_valid(temp)
st_is_valid(temp_valid)
temp_valid
st_geometry_type(temp_valid)
st_geometry_type(temp_valid, by_geometry = FALSE)
```

When we look at the corrected data set, we see that the invalid polygon was converted to a multipolygon. We can also check it using the `st_geometry_type()` function. This is however a problem since we normally don't want a data set with mixed geometry types. When we use the `by_geometry = FALSE` argument, we see that `sf` is now using a generic GEOMETRY type for the data set. The solution would be to convert all the other polygons to multipolygons.

### Vector type casting

Changing the type of vector features is done with the `st_cast()` function. We can now solve our previous problem and convert everything to multipolygons (the existing multipolygon will be left untouched). Using the `st_as_text()` function we can see the WKT representation of the features geometry, and confirm that we're now using the same vector type for all features.

```{r}
temp_multipoly <- st_cast(temp_valid, to = "MULTIPOLYGON")
st_as_text(st_geometry(temp_valid))
st_as_text(st_geometry(temp_multipoly))
st_geometry_type(temp_multipoly, by_geometry = FALSE)
```

We can go a bit further and convert our multipolygons to other types... Note: for some reasons, it is not possible to convert a multipolygon directly to a line. You'll need to convert it to a multiline object first.

```{r}
temp_poly <- st_cast(temp_multipoly, to = "POLYGON")
temp_multiline <- st_cast(temp_multipoly, to = "MULTILINESTRING")
temp_line <- st_cast(temp_multiline, to = "LINESTRING")
temp_multipts <- st_cast(temp_multipoly, to = "MULTIPOINT")
temp_pts <- st_cast(temp_multipoly, to = "POINT")

temp_poly
temp_multiline
temp_line
temp_multipts
temp_pts

par(mfrow=c(2, 3))
plot(st_geometry(temp_multipoly), col = 1:nrow(temp_multipoly))
plot(st_geometry(temp_poly), col = 1:nrow(temp_poly))
plot(st_geometry(temp_multiline), col = 1:nrow(temp_multiline))
plot(st_geometry(temp_line), col = 1:nrow(temp_line))
plot(st_geometry(temp_multipts), col = 1:nrow(temp_multipts), pch = 16)
plot(st_geometry(temp_pts), col = 1:nrow(temp_pts), pch = 16)
```

It is of course not possible to convert points to polygons, but if you have a line or multiline geometry forming a closed ring, we can easily convert it to a polygon.

```{r}
sempach_multiline <- st_cast(muni[which(muni$name == "Sempach"),], to = "MULTILINESTRING")
plot(st_geometry(sempach_multiline), col = "navy")
sempach_poly <- st_cast(sempach_multiline, to = "POLYGON")
plot(st_geometry(sempach_poly), col = "navy")
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Create a new object containing only the polygon for Sursee, check its validity and compute its perimeter using the `st_length()` function, compare with the result of the `st_perimeter()` function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
sursee_poly <- muni[which(muni$name == "Sursee"),]
sursee_multiline <- st_cast(sursee_poly, to = "MULTILINESTRING")
st_length(sursee_multiline)
st_perimeter(sursee_poly)
```

### Spatial predicates

Topology describes the spatial relationships between vector objects. Two features can for example intersect, or one feature can contain another. The existence of such relationships between features is tested by functions called spatial (binary) predicates. Many are available in the `sf` package, use `?geos_binary_pred` if you want to see the full list.

::: callout-important
When using spatial predicates you must be sure that both objects use the same CRS.
:::

We can for example easily test which bird sightings are in Sempach.

```{r}
sempach <- muni[muni$name=="Sempach",]
obs_in_sempach <- st_intersects(obs, sempach)
obs_in_sempach
summary(lengths(obs_in_sempach) > 0)
```

The output is stored in an memory efficient sparse matrix format which not easily readable by humans. We can use the `sparse = FALSE` argument to get a non-sparse matrix and perform standard operations (e.g. computing the number of sightings in Sempach).

```{r}
obs_in_sempach <- st_intersects(obs, sempach, sparse = FALSE)
tail(obs_in_sempach)
sum(obs_in_sempach)
```

Using another predicate (`st_disjoint`), we can get a list of all sightings that are in other municipalities.

```{r}
obs_not_in_sempach <- st_disjoint(obs, sempach, sparse = FALSE)
sum(obs_not_in_sempach)
```

We can easily find all the sightings that are located within 1km of the Swiss Ornithological Institute.

```{r}
soi <- st_as_sfc("POINT(2657271 1219754)", crs = "EPSG:2056")
st_is_within_distance(soi, obs, dist = 1000)
```

Things can get a bit more complex when the two elements used inside the predicate contain multiple feature. In this example we test for intersections between two municipalities and all the highway segments stored in the streets data set.

```{r}
muni_extract <- muni[6:7,]
highways <- streets[streets$type == 2,]
st_intersects(muni_extract, highways)
```

Don't hesitate to try other predicate (e.g. `st_within()`, `st_contains()`). The difference between some of them is sometimes quite subtle. If you need even more flexibility you should use the `st_relate()` function. This flexibility comes with a price, `st_relate()` is much slower since it doesn't use spatial indices. If you want an in-depth explanation of all the possibilities, you should check the following website: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM>.

### Spatial subsetting

Now that we know how to test different topological properties, we can use them to subset data spatially. The `sf` package allows doing that using the usual `[]` notation. This is how we create a new `sf` object containing only the sightings in Sempach. The st_intersects predicate is used by default if you don't specify anything.

```{r}
obs_in_sempach <- obs[sempach,]
# Equivalent to
obs_in_sempach <- obs[sempach, , op = st_intersects]
```

The empty argument can be used to specify the desired attribute columns.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Within a 2 km radius around Swiss Ornithological Institute, how many bird sightings are in Neuenkirch? Try to make a map of the municipalities with the filtered sightings.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
neuenkirch <- muni[which(muni$name == "Neuenkirch"),]
obs_within_2000m <- obs[soi, , op = st_is_within_distance, dist = 1000]
obs_filtered <- obs_within_2000m[neuenkirch,]
nrow(obs_filtered)
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(st_geometry(obs_filtered), add = TRUE)
```
:::

### Spatial joins

We've already seen how to join a spatial object to another table using attributes. Now we'll do something similar but instead of using attributes, we'll perform the join between to spatial objects based on their topological relationships. As a first example we will join the bird sightings data set with the municipalities data set. As output we will get the bird sightings with additional attributes corresponding to their respective municipality. We'll do this using the `st_join()` function.

```{r}
obs_muni <- st_join(obs, muni, join = st_intersects)
obs_muni
table(obs_muni$name.y)
```

In this example both data sets have an attributed called "name". When we join them together, R is automatically renaming these columns to "name.x" and "name.y". The "x" and "y" corresponds to the order of the data sets when calling the `st_join()` function.

Let's try another spatial join, this time we will join the sightings with a landcover data set, which is an extract of the swissTLM3D data set provided by Swisstopo. The goal of the analysis it to add a new attribute to the bird sightings data set corresponding to the landcover value.

```{r}
landcover <- st_read("data/geodata.gpkg", "landcover", quiet = TRUE)
obs_landcover <- st_join(obs, landcover, join = st_intersects)
obs_landcover
table(obs_landcover$type, useNA = "always")
```

By default the `st_join()` function will use `st_intersects` as a predicate, but you can of course specify a different one. Moreover it performs what is called a left join, which means the output will contain all rows from the first object (`obs` in our example). It is also possible to perform an inner join by adding the attribute `left = FALSE`. In this case the output will contain only the rows for which a value was found (i.e. where a spatial match occurred).

```{r}
obs_landcover_inner <- st_join(obs, landcover, join = st_intersects, left = FALSE)
obs_landcover_inner
table(obs_landcover_inner$type, useNA = "always")
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Have a look at the number of features (rows) of the original `obs` data set and compare it with the number of features of the `obs_landcover` data set. Why are they different?

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
nrow(obs)
nrow(obs_landcover)
# This difference is caused by overlapping polygons in the landcover data set. If a bird sighting
# is inside 2 polygons, the st_join() function will create 2 rows (one row for each intersecting polygon).
# This means some sightings will be duplicated. We call this kind of joins "one-to-many".
# You can find these duplicated sightings by looking at the row names with the rownames() function, or by
# adding an unique ID to all the sightings before the spatial join and then looking for duplicated IDs.
```
:::

Since the landcover data is not a complete coverage of our study area, which leads to NA values in our joined data set, we can maybe try to get more complete results by using another spatial predicate. The `st_nearest_feature` predicate will join the sightings to the nearest landcover polygon. Polygons containing points will be considered to be the closest ones. I honestly don't know what is happening when a point is within two overlapping polygons.

```{r}
obs_landcover2 <- st_join(obs, landcover, join = st_nearest_feature)
obs_landcover2
table(obs_landcover2$type, useNA = "always")
```

In this example we joined a point data set to a polygon data set and this is the most common application for a spatial join. However we're not restricted to these combinations, we can join all the vector types (e.g. polygons with polygons). If you're joining polygons to polygons, `st_join()` is also able to perform joins based on the maximum area overlay (it joins with the polygon having the largest overlap). To do this, you need to add the `largest = TRUE` argument.

### Distance operations

Calculating distances between `sf` objects is done with the `st_distance()` function.

```{r}
st_distance(obs[1,], soi)
```

Once again, we see that `sf` is using units. We also note that the results are stored in a matrix instead of a vector. This format is actually needed since `st_distance()` can also be used to compute all the distance combinations between two `sf` objects containing multiple features.

```{r}
st_distance(obs[1:5,], muni[1:3,])
```

We will now make a short excursion in the world of geographic CRS with a quick example showing what `sf` is doing when we don't use standard Euclidean geometry. We will compute the distance between the centroids of Switzerland and Australia. By default `sf` is using the `s2` library to perform its computation on a spheroid when we use a geographic CRS. However for distances, it is possible to obtain a better approximation by using an ellipsoid. To do this, we need to tell `sf` not to use `s2` and the `st_distance()` will use a more precise algorithm. We can of course compare the two estimates.

```{r}
world_centroids <- st_centroid(World)
pt1 <- world_centroids[world_centroids$name == "Switzerland",]
pt2 <- world_centroids[world_centroids$name == "Australia",]

sf_use_s2(FALSE)
(d1 <- st_distance(pt1, pt2))
sf_use_s2(TRUE)
(d2 <- st_distance(pt1, pt2))
d2 - d1
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(sp)
library(geosphere)
tmp1 <- as(pt1, "Spatial")
tmp2 <- as(pt2, "Spatial")
gcLine <- greatCircle(tmp1, tmp2, sp = TRUE)
gcLine <- st_as_sf(gcLine)

world_proj <- st_transform(World, "ESRI:54030")
pt1_proj <- st_transform(pt1, "ESRI:54030")
pt2_proj <- st_transform(pt2, "ESRI:54030")
gcLine_proj <- st_transform(gcLine, "ESRI:54030")

pt3 <- st_snap(pt1_proj, gcLine_proj, 10000)
pt4 <- st_snap(pt2_proj, gcLine_proj, 100000)
part <- st_collection_extract(st_split(gcLine_proj$geometry, pt3$geometry), "LINESTRING")[2]
part <- st_collection_extract(st_split(part, pt4$geometry), "LINESTRING")[1]

extent <- world_proj[which(world_proj$name == "Iceland" | world_proj$name == "Norway" | world_proj$name == "Australia"),]
plot(st_geometry(world_proj), extent = extent, col = "grey90")
plot(part, add = TRUE, lwd = 2, col = "red")
plot(st_geometry(pt1_proj), add = TRUE, pch = 16, col = "red")
plot(st_geometry(pt2_proj), add = TRUE, pch = 16, col = "red")

rm(tmp1, tmp2, gcLine, world_proj, pt1_proj, pt2_proj, gcLine_proj, pt3, pt4, part, extent)
```

### Buffers

Buffering objects is one of the most common operations in GIS. A buffer is a polygon showing the area within a given distance of a spatial object. You can buffer all the existing vector types with the `st_buffer()` function.

```{r}
obs_buff <- st_buffer(obs[c(1, 2, 5),], dist = 80)
plot(st_geometry(obs_buff), col = 2:4)
```

In the GIS world curves are often approximated using small segments, even though curves exists in the Simple Feature standard (but they're often poorly implemented in GIS software). The number of segments used to create the buffers is controlled by the argument `nQuadSegs` (= number of segments per quadrant). You can change this value to create buffers with octagonal shapes. You can also increase the default value if you need better precision (especially useful for very large buffers).

```{r}
obs_buff_oct <- st_buffer(obs[c(1, 2, 5),], dist = 80, nQuadSegs = 2)
plot(st_geometry(obs_buff_oct), col = 2:4)
```

Each feature will get its own buffer, which means that, if they're close enough and/or the distance is large enough, the buffers will overlap but they're still separate features. It is possible to merge overlapping buffers using the `st_union()` function. The function will produce a single multipolygon, that's why we need transform the output into a polygon to recover the non-overlapping buffers as separate features. Note that you will use the attributes of the buffers with this operation. If you need to recover some of them, you can use a spatial join.

```{r}
obs_buff_merged <- st_union(obs_buff)
obs_buff_merged <- st_cast(obs_buff_merged, "POLYGON")
plot(obs_buff_merged, col = 2:3)
```

### Affine transformations

`sf` provide methods to transform `sfc` and `sfg` objects, this is however not possible with `sf` objects (but have a look at the trick at the end of this section). Shifting a geometry is the easiest operation. The next example will shift the borders of Sempach, 500 meters to the north and 200 meters to the east. The shift is always done using the unit defined in the CRS used by the spatial object.

```{r}
sempach_sfc <- st_geometry(sempach)
sempach_sfc_shift <- sempach_sfc + c(500, 200)
```

We can also scale the geometries, but we need a reference point (such as the centroid) for each feature. Once we have these reference points, we can center them by shifting the geometries, apply the scaling, and shift them back to their original locations.

```{r}
muni_sfc <- st_geometry(muni)
muni_sfc_centroids <- st_centroid(muni_sfc)
muni_sfc_scale <- (muni_sfc - muni_sfc_centroids) * 0.5 + muni_sfc_centroids

plot(muni_sfc, col = "grey90")
plot(muni_sfc_scale, col = "navy", add = TRUE)
```

Rotation is the last common affine transformation. We also need to define a reference point for each feature and perform the same shifting operations. However, instead of multiplying with a scalar we now use a rotation matrix. Remember that a 2D vector (i.e. coordinates) will be rotated by an angle $\theta$ when we multiply it with the following matrix:

$$R=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta)\\
\sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)
\end{pmatrix}
$$

We can of course combine scaling and rotation...

```{r}
rotation <- function(theta){
  theta_rad <- theta * pi / 180
  matrix(c(cos(theta_rad), sin(theta_rad), -sin(theta_rad), cos(theta_rad)), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
}

muni_sfc_rotate <- (muni_sfc - muni_sfc_centroids) * rotation(30) + muni_sfc_centroids
muni_sfc_scale_rotate <- (muni_sfc - muni_sfc_centroids) * 0.5 * rotation(30) + muni_sfc_centroids

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(muni_sfc, col = "grey90")
plot(muni_sfc_rotate, col = "navy", add = TRUE)

plot(muni_sfc, col = "grey90")
plot(muni_sfc_scale_rotate, col = "navy", add = TRUE)
```

Once all the transformations are performed, we can use the `st_set_geometry()` function to create a new `sf` object combining the new geometry with the attributes of the original `sf` object.

```{r}
muni2 <- st_set_geometry(muni, muni_sfc_scale_rotate)
```

### Combining geometries

Combining geometries from two different data sets is one of the most common analysis performed in a GIS. The four main operations are the following ones: union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference. The following figure shows a graphical overview of these operations with the function names (source: Lovelace *et al.*, 2019):

![](figures/venn-clip-1.png)

As we've seen earlier, the `st_union()` function can also be used with a single data set to merge geometries.

```{r}
muni_merged <- st_union(muni)
muni_merged
plot(muni_merged, col = "navy")
```

But it can also be used to merge geometries between two `sf` objects having the same vector type.

```{r}
temp_poly <- st_geometry(st_buffer(obs[1,], 2000))
plot(st_union(temp_poly, sempach))
```

As as another example, let's calculate the intersection between our new polygon and the municipality of Sempach.

```{r}
muni_inter <- st_intersection(sempach, temp_poly)
muni_inter
plot(st_geometry(muni_inter))
```

In a perfect world you'll get polygons as output when you combine polygon (or multipolygon) objects with one of these functions. However, you may also get something more exotic. Let's have a look at the following example which comes from one of the `sf` vignettes.

```{r}
a <- st_polygon(list(cbind(c(0, 0, 7.5, 7.5, 0), c(0, -1, -1, 0, 0))))
b <- st_polygon(list(cbind(c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 0), c(1, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 1, 1))))
(inter <- st_intersection(a, b))

par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(0, 1, 3, 1))
plot(a, ylim = c(-1, 1))
title("Intersecting two polygons:")
plot(b, add = TRUE, border = "red")
plot(a, ylim = c(-1, 1))
title("GEOMETRYCOLLECTION")
plot(b, add = TRUE, border = "red")
plot(inter, add = TRUE, col = "green", lwd = 2)
```

Geometry collections are defined in the Simple Feature standard as a collection of different vector types. For example, one feature (row) could contain 2 polygons, 1 multiline and 3 points. The output of the previous is clearly a geometry collection since the `st_intersection()` function produced 1 polygon, 1 line and 1 point. When performing an intersection or a similar operation, it is important to check that all the produced features have the expected geometry type. An geometry collection output is maybe not so common, but you may get a combination of polygons and multipolygons. Use the `st_geometry_type()` function (maybe in combination with `unique()`) to inspect the types.

Ideally we would use geometry collections directly in our analyses but you'll quickly notice that most functions don't work with them (and most GIS software don't really know what to do with them either). Therefore you'll need to decide which part of the collection is important for you. If you intersect polygons with polygons, most of the time you'll be interested in the polygons and multipolygons outputs. You can use the `st_collection_extract()` function to perform this task.

```{r}
st_collection_extract(inter, "POLYGON")
```

plot(temp_inter[1:3], col = "red", add = TRUE)
plot(temp_inter[4], col = "blue", add = TRUE)
```

### Aggregate by attributes

Aggregation can be based purely on the attributes, treating the `sf` object as a dataframe using the standard `aggregate()` function. However, the `sf` package also extends the `aggregate()` function if you use a `sf` object as the first argument. Note that the nice formula notation is not possible in this case.

```{r}
aggregate(pop_est ~ continent, FUN = sum, data = World, na.rm = TRUE)
world_agg <- aggregate(World["pop_est"], list(World$continent), FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)
world_agg
plot(world_agg[,"pop_est"])
```

Note that the merging is not perfect since some country borders where not perfectly contiguous.

Combining aggregation with intersections allows us to compute interesting parameters for our study area. For example we can compute the total street length in buffers around bird sightings. The `st_agr()` function tells `sf` how the attributes of the data set should be considered. Here we we consider that the attributes are constant within each buffer. Depending on your version of `sf` you might get an error if you don't add this line.

```{r}
obs_buff <- st_buffer(obs[c(1, 100, 400), 1], dist = 1000)
obs_buff$site <- 1:3
st_agr(obs_buff) <- "constant"
streets_clip <- st_intersection(obs_buff, st_geometry(streets))
aggregate(st_length(streets_clip), by = list(site = streets_clip$site), FUN = "sum")
```

### Generate sample points

If you need to generated points inside a polygon according to some sampling design, you'll need the `st_sample()` function. Have a look at the help file to see all the sampling types available. In the next example we sample 100 points in Sempach based on two different designs.

```{r}
samples_random <- st_sample(sempach, 100, type = "random")
samples_regular <- st_sample(sempach, 100, type = "regular")

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(st_geometry(sempach), col = "grey90")
plot(samples_random, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(sempach), col = "grey90")
plot(samples_regular, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, add = TRUE)
```

If you need more sampling methods, you can also use the ones provided by the `spatstat.random` package (you'll need to install it first). The next example shows how to use a simple sequential inhibition process (SSI) to sample 100 random points that are at least 50 meters apart. You can easily check that the constraint was applied by using the `st_distance()` function.

```{r}
samples_ssi <- st_sample(sempach, r = 50, n = 100, type = "SSI")
temp_dist <- st_distance(samples_ssi)
min(temp_dist[temp_dist > 0])
plot(st_geometry(sempach), col = "grey90")
plot(st_geometry(samples_ssi), pch = 16, cex = 0.5, add = TRUE)
```

### Convex hulls

Sometimes you'll need to use a polygon enclosing all your geometries. This is for example often used as a crude way to estimate an animal home range based on its sightings. Convex hulls are often called minimum convex polygons (MCP) in the ecological literature. Here we extract all the White Wagtail sightings in Neuenkirch and compute the minimum convex polygon. Note that we need to group the sightings into a single multipolygon using the `st_union()` function first. Otherwise we'll get a separate convex hull for each point (and the convex hull of a single point is also a point).

```{r}
obs_wagtail <- obs[obs$name == "White Wagtail",]
obs_wagtail_neuenkirch <- obs_wagtail[muni[muni$name == "Neuenkirch",],]
conv_hull <- st_convex_hull(st_union(obs_wagtail_neuenkirch))
plot(conv_hull, col = "grey90")
plot(st_geometry(obs_wagtail_neuenkirch), pch = 16, add = TRUE)
```

If you're computing home ranges and need a minimum convex polygon enclosing only a given percentage of the points (e.g. 95%), have a look at the `mcp()` function in the `adehabitatHR` package.

### CRS transformations

If the data sets you're using have different CRSs, it's usually a good idea to transform some of them so that they all have the same CRS. We need the `st_transform()` function to do this. Sometimes we also say that we "project" the data to another CRS (however, transformations between geographic CRSs are not really projections).

Here we first check the CRS of the `World` data set using the `st_crs()` function and compute a graticule (grid). Then we project the data set to three different projected CRSs, the Swiss CRS, the Equal Earth projection and the Robinson projection. If we use a CRS with an EPSG number, we can also use the integer value directly (without specifying "EPSG:"). However it's a good habit to always specify the provider to avoid confusions.

```{r}
st_crs(World)
grat <- st_graticule()
world_ch <- st_transform(World, "EPSG:2056")
grat_ch <- st_transform(grat, "EPSG:2056")
world_equal <- st_transform(World, "EPSG:8857")
grat_equal <- st_transform(grat, "EPSG:8857")
world_rob <- st_transform(World, "ESRI:54030")
grat_rob <- st_transform(grat, "ESRI:54030")
```

When we plot that data, we first see that, not surprisingly, the Swiss CRS is not adapted at all for global data, and that the Equal Earth and Robinson projections give a pleasing result. Both of these projections are good choices for world maps.

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 1
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
plot(st_geometry(World), col = "grey90")
plot(st_geometry(grat), col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(world_ch), col = "grey90")
plot(st_geometry(grat_ch), col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(world_equal), col = "grey90")
plot(st_geometry(grat_equal), col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(world_rob), col = "grey90")
plot(st_geometry(grat_rob), col = "lightgrey", add = TRUE)
```

The `st_crs()` function is used to query or assign a CRS, but it does not perform any CRS transformation!

### Neighborhood analyses

We've already seen that the `sf` package provides some nice functions to study the topology of geometries. If you need more you can have a look at the `spdep` package which excels at neighborhood analyses. First we compute a neighbor list based on municipalities sharing a common boundary using the `poly2nb()` function.

```{r}
library(spdep)
muni_neigh <- poly2nb(muni)
muni_neigh
summary(muni_neigh)
str(muni_neigh)
```

The output is stored as a list with the same ordering as the input data sets. For example we see that the municipality 1 (Neuenkirch) is neighboring municipalities 2 (Nottwil) and 3 (Sempach). Since it's stored as a list, we can easily get the number of neighbors for all the municipalities.

```{r}
sapply(muni_neigh, length)
```

We can also compare the results of the `poly2nb()` function with the results of the `st_touches()` function provided by `sf`. Fortunately, the outputs are identical.

```{r}
st_touches(muni)
```

The `spdep` package provides plotting functions to visualize the neighbor lists. When working with polygons, we need to provide the coordinates of the centroids to the `plot()` function.

```{r}
muni_centroids_coords <- st_coordinates(st_centroid(muni))
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(muni_neigh, muni_centroids_coords, add = TRUE)
text(muni_centroids_coords, labels = 1:nrow(muni), pos = 3)
```

Looking for the closest neighbors to some feature is also a common neighborhood analysis (called K-nearest neighbors). Here we look for the two closest nearest neighbors of each municipality. To do that we use the `knearneigh()` function. This function only accepts point geometries so we need to use the centroids (and hence all the distances will be computed between centroids and not between the polygon boundaries). To get a neighbor list we use the `knn2nb()` function on the output of the `knearneigh()` function.

```{r}
muni_knb <- knn2nb(knearneigh(muni_centroids_coords, k = 2))
muni_knb
is.symmetric.nb(muni_knb)
muni_knb2 <- make.sym.nb(muni_knb)
is.symmetric.nb(muni_knb2)
```

The resulting neighbor list will often be asymmetric. For example the two closest neighbors from municipality 1 (Neuenkirch) are municipalities 2 (Nottwil) and 3 (Sempach). However the two closest neighbors of municipality 2 are municipalities 4 and 5. Hence the link between municipalities 1 and 2 is asymmetric. We can use the `make.sym.nb()` function to make everything symmetric, but after applying this function we will have some municipalities with more than two neighbors. Let's have a look at the plot of the two computed neighborhoods (symmetric and asymmetric).

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(muni_knb, muni_centroids_coords, pch = 16, col = "blue", arrows = TRUE, add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(muni_knb2, muni_centroids_coords, pch = 16, col = "blue", arrows = TRUE, add = TRUE)
```

The K-nearest neighbor analysis also allows us to compute other quantities. For example we can easily compute the minimum distance so that each community has at least one neighbor. We use the `nbdists()` function to compute all the neighborhood distances, and since its output is a list we need to use the `unlist()` function to convert it to a vector.

```{r}
muni_knb3 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(muni_centroids_coords, k = 1))
distances <- unlist(nbdists(muni_knb3, muni_centroids_coords))
(dist1nb <- max(distances))
```

The `dnearneigh()` function is similar to the `knearneigh` function. It computes a list of all the neighbors within a specific distance. Similarly, the `dnearneigh()` function only accepts point geometries so we need to work with the centroids. Using this function we can also check that our computed minimum distance to have at least one neighbor is correct.

```{r}
dnb1 <- dnearneigh(muni_centroids_coords, d1 = 0, d2 = 0.75 * dist1nb)
dnb2 <- dnearneigh(muni_centroids_coords, d1 = 0, d2 = 1 * dist1nb)
dnb3 <- dnearneigh(muni_centroids_coords, d1 = 0, d2 = 1.25 * dist1nb)

par(mfrow = c(1, 3), mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1))
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(dnb1, muni_centroids_coords, pch = 16, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(dnb2, muni_centroids_coords, pch = 16, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(muni))
plot(dnb3, muni_centroids_coords, pch = 16, col = "blue", add = TRUE)
```

Neighborhood lists provide an efficient way to store neighborhood information thanks to their sparse structure, but sometimes it's nice to work with the full neighborhood matrix. You can use the `nb2mat()` function to get the matrix.

```{r}
nb2mat(muni_neigh, style = "B")
```

If you want to save the neighborhood as a `sf` line object, you can create the lines using the `nb2lines()` function.

```{r}
neigh_sf <- nb2lines(muni_neigh, coords = st_geometry(muni_centroid))
```

Neighborhood information is sometimes needed to fit more complex statistical models accounting for spatial autocorrelation (e.g. CAR models). You can fit some of these models in R, but sometimes you'll need another software such as INLA or WinBUGS. The `spdep` package provide functions to export the neighborhood lists so that they can be used with these software.

```{r}
#| eval: false
nb_winbugs <- nb2WB(muni_neigh)
nb2INLA(file = "export/nbinla.txt", muni_neigh)
```

## Tips and tricks for rasters

### Reading and writing raster data

As we saw earlier, we need another package to import raster data sets. The `rast()` function from the `terra` package is what we need. It doesn't matter if our raster is continuous, discrete, or contains several bands, the `rast()` function will create the correct `terra` object. However don't forget that it's only a pointer to the data set, the full raster is not imported into memory. Calling the object will display some basic information about the data set.

The digital elevation model is an extract of the DHM25 data set provided by Swisstopo, the orthophoto is an extract of the SWISSIMAGE data set also provided by Swisstopo.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
if(file.exists("export/dem.csv")) {file.remove("export/dem.csv")}
if(file.exists("export/dem1.tif")) {file.remove("export/dem1.tif")}
if(file.exists("export/dem2.tif")) {file.remove("export/dem2.tif")}
```

```{r}
library(terra)
elev <- rast("data/dem.tif")
elev
plot(elev)
ortho <- rast("data/sempach_ortho.tif")
ortho
plot(ortho)
```

Note that the orthophoto was plotted in a different way (no axes, no legend). The `terra` package automatically detected that the raster had 3 bands and made the assumption that the bands corresponded to red, green and blue intensity values. If this assumption is not correct, you can use the `plotRGB()` function to get the desired plot.

Similarly we can import a raster containing discrete values, such as a landcover/landuse data set. The following one is an extract from the Swiss landuse statistics, provided by the Federal Statistical Office. Note that the CRS is not defined, this will happen more often with raster data found in the wild than with vector data. Fortunately we know which CRS was used and we can add this information to the data set. Moreover, `terra` is not recognizing automatically that we're processing a discrete raster. That's why we need to use the `as.factor()` function.

```{r}
landcover <- rast("data/landcover.tif")
landcover
crs(landcover) <- "EPSG:2056"
landcover <- as.factor(landcover)
plot(landcover)
```

Rasters are nice objects to work with but sometimes it's nice with more familiar R objects. You can easily convert `SpatRaster` objects to dataframes containing the geographic coordinates of all pixels and the related pixel values.

```{r}
elev_vals <- values(elev)
head(elev_vals)
elev_df <- as.data.frame(elev, xy = TRUE)
head(elev_df)
write.csv(elev_df, "export/dem.csv")
```

Similarly, if you have a dataframe containing geographic coordinates located on a regular grid and associated values, you can easily convert it to a `terra` object with the help of the `rast()` function, by adding the argument `type = "xyz"`. This is often useful if you want to plot the predictions of a statistical model on a map, for example the distribution of a species. Here we add a new column to some dataframe filled with random values and we convert it to a 2-band raster.

```{r}
elev_df$rand <- rnorm(nrow(elev_df))

elev2 <- rast(elev_df, type = "xyz")
elev2
plot(elev2)
```

Exporting raster data set is really easy thanks to the `writeRaster()` function. The format will be automatically recognized based on the file name extension. As we saw in the introduction, the GeoTiff format is almost always the format we should use.

```{r}
writeRaster(elev, "export/dem1.tif")
writeRaster(elev2, "export/dem2.tif")
```

Remember that the first raster was a single band raster and the second one had two bands. What is happening when we visualize the latter with QGIS? It looks like QGIS is combining the bands like an RGB raster. If you want to only export a single band, you can subset the raster data set using `[[]]`, either using the band number or name.

```{r}
writeRaster(elev2[[1]], "export/dem2.tif", overwrite = TRUE)
writeRaster(elev2[["dem"]], "export/dem2.tif", overwrite = TRUE)
```

### Summarize rasters

In the GIS world, functions acting on the whole raster (using all pixels) to produce some output are called global functions. They are mostly used to produce some descriptive statistics on the data set. It is therefore not so surprising that `terra` provides such a function. If you prefer plots, the `hist()` and `boxplot()` functions have also been extended to support `SpatRaster` objects.

```{r}
global(elev, fun = "max")
hist(elev)
boxplot(elev)
```

You can define you own function when using the `global()` function. However they will be much slower than the standard functions provided by `terra`, or may even fail.

For discrete rasters, you can easily get the frequency distribution of all the available categories.

```{r}
freq(landcover)
```

### Spatial subsetting

If you need to spatially subset a raster, you can either use another raster defining the zone you want to extract, or a polygon enclosing the area. First we'll have a look at the former. We first import our raster mask.

```{r}
rmask <- rast("data/sempach_raster.tif")
plot(rmask, col = "blue")
```

Don't forget that regular raster data sets are always rectangular. The raster mask we're now using is the municipality of Sempach. We see its shape, but the data set is still a rectangle. All the other pixels in the raster extent are NAs (you can quickly check it using the `values()` function).

First we need to use the `crop()` function, which will crop our DEM raster to the extent of the mask. This will also work if the mask is not perfectly align with the other raster, but in this case `terra` will perform a slight shift of the extent of the mask so that everything is aligned.

```{r}
elev_crop <- crop(elev, rmask)
# Identical to
elev_crop <- elev[rmask, , drop = FALSE]
plot(elev_crop)
```

We can then perform the masking once we have two rasters with the same extent and alignment. If your mask is not perfectly aligned, you'll need to shift (have a look at the `shift()` function) it or even resample it (see next section).

```{r}
elev_mask <- mask(elev_crop, rmask)
plot(elev_mask)
```

Now let's have a look at the second possibility: masking and cropping using a vector data set. This is considerably easier since you don't need to have perfect alignment but this can be a bit slower for complex masks.

```{r}
elev_crop2 <- crop(elev, sempach)
plot(elev_crop2)
elev_mask2 <- mask(elev, sempach)
plot(elev_mask2)
elev_mask2 <- trim(elev_mask2)
plot(elev_mask2)
```

With vector data, you can directly use the `mask()` function, without clipping the extent with the `crop()` function first. However you'll still get the original extent, which means a lot of pixels with NAs. The trim() function allows cleaning things a bit by removing outer rows and columns full of NAs.

### Aggregation and resampling

Sometimes you will need to reduce the resolution of your rasters (e.g. if they're too large to be processed efficiently). This can be easily achieve using the `aggregate()` function. The `fact` argument is the aggregation factor. For example a value of 2 means 2 pixels in the horizontal direction and 2 pixels in the vertical direction, so that 4 pixels will be aggregated into one. If you need to disaggregate a raster, have a look at the `disagg()` function.

```{r}
elev_agg <- aggregate(elev, fact = 20)
plot(elev_agg)
```

By default the `aggregate()` function will use the arithmetic mean to merge the pixel values, but you're free to use other functions (including your own ones). As you can guess, we need to be a bit careful when using discrete rasters since most functions won't make any sense. The following one (`fun = "modal"`) will use the most frequent category as the new pixel value.

```{r}
landcover_agg <- aggregate(landcover, fact = 5, fun = "modal")
plot(landcover_agg)
```

Combining rasters is really easy when they're perfectly aligned (same extent, same resolution). However most of the times we get data sets that don't satisfy this condition. If possible we should first try to slightly shift and/or aggregate the rasters (or maybe crop/extend the extents). If the differences are too big, we need to transform the raster in a more radical way, we need resampling. This means taking the values of our original raster and calculate new values for our target extent and resolution.

The first argument of the resample() function is the raster that needs to be resampled, the second argument is used to provide the target extent and resolution, and the third one is used to indicates the method that will be used for the interpolation of the new values. The bilinear interpolation is the default and is appropriate for continuous rasters. It assigns a weighted average of the four nearest cells of the original raster to the cell of the target one. Other interpolation algorithms are available for continuous rasters (e.g. cubic, cubic spline, etc.). However all of this don't make any sense when we need to resample a discrete raster. For them we need to use the nearest neighbor interpolation. It assigns the value of the nearest cell of the original raster to the cell of the target one.

```{r}
elev_resample <- resample(elev, landcover, method = "bilinear")
elev_resample
compareGeom(elev_resample, landcover)
landcover_resample <- resample(landcover, elev, method = "near")
landcover_resample
compareGeom(landcover_resample, elev)
```

The `compareGeom()` function that the rasters have the same geometries (by default: same extent, number of rows and columns, projection, resolution, and origin), and hence are now aligned. Check how the extent and resolution changed after the resampling.

### Classify rasters

Sometimes you'll need to classify/reclassify rasters. For a continuous raster we can easily do this by hand, but as we will see `terra` is providing more efficient functions.

```{r}
elev_recl <- elev
elev_recl[elev_recl <= 500] <- 1
elev_recl[elev_recl > 500 & elev_recl <= 700] <- 2
elev_recl[elev_recl > 700] <- 3
plot(elev_recl)
```

This is much easier if we use the `classify()` function. For a continuous raster, we just need to define the breaks. The last argument means that the pixels having a value equal to the lowest break will be included in the first class. This usually makes sense when categorizing continuous rasters (but this is not the default option). The output of the `classify()` function also provides better labels for the classes.

```{r}
elev_recl <- classify(elev, c(0, 500, 700, Inf), include.lowest = TRUE)
plot(elev_recl)
```

If we need to reclassify a discrete raster, we need to create a matrix with 2 columns, with the first column containing the old values and the second column containing the corresponding new values.

```{r}
reclMat_landcover <- matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6, 1, 7, 1, 8, 1, 9, 1, 10, 1, 11, 2, 12, 2,
                    13, 2, 14, 2, 15, 2, 16, 2, 17, 2, 18, 2, 19, 3, 20, 3, 21, 3, 22, 3, 23, 4,
                    24, 4, 25, 4, 26, 4), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
landcover_recl <- classify(landcover, reclMat_landcover)
plot(landcover_recl)
```

With a discrete raster, we can easily create a new raster data set containing separate binary layers based on the categories. This process is often called one-hot encoding or dummy encoding (and is totally similar to what R is doing when you fit a linear model with a discrete variable).

```{r}
landcover_layers <- segregate(landcover_recl)
names(landcover_layers) <- c("settlements", "agriculture", "forest", "unproductive")
plot(landcover_layers)
```

## Exercise (5 minutes)

```{r}

#| code-fold: true
forests <- landcover_layers[["forest"]]

```
:::

### Extract pixel values

Before doing a statistical analysis, it is quite common to collect all the covariates as GIS layers. We've already seen how to extract information from vector data sets using spatial joins. There is a similar procedure for raster data sets. The most common operation consists of extracting raster values at some given points/sites.

Note that `terra` is using its own data model to store and process vector data (and hence doesn't use the classes defined by `sf`). The `terra` class for vector data is called `SpatVector`. Fortunately it is very easy to convert `sf` objects to `SpatVector` objects using the `vect()` function. If you need to convert a `SpatVector` object to `sf`, you can use the `st_as_sf()` function.

```{r}
vals <- extract(elev, vect(obs), ID = FALSE)
obs2 <- obs
obs2$elev <- vals
```

The output of the `extract()` function is a standard dataframe. The order of the dataframe is the same as the order of the vector data set used to extract the data, you can therefore easily append the extracted values to the `sf` point object.

If you're lucky enough to have properly aligned rasters, you can combine them in a multiband data set and use the `extract()` function on this new data set. You'll also get a dataframe, with one column for each band.

```{r}
covariates <- c(landcover, elev_resample)
names(covariates) <- c("landcover", "elevation")
vals <- extract(covariates, vect(obs), ID = FALSE)
```

You're actually not restricted to using points to extract information from rasters. For example using a line you can easily compute an elevation profile. Using polygons is even more powerful and allow performing what is usually called zonal analyses. By default the `extract()` function will extract all the pixels whose centroid is within the polygons.

```{r}
vals <- extract(elev, vect(obs_buff))
head(vals)
```

The `ID` values corresponds to the ordering of the polygons of the `sf` object. This means that all rows with `ID=1` are pixels intersection the first polygon. You're then free to use these values, for example to characterize some habitat. If you only need some summary statistic for each polygon, you can use the `fun` argument to specify some aggregating function.

```{r}
vals_avg <- extract(elev, vect(obs_buff), fun = mean)
```

The `extract()` function is really powerful (and fast) and has a lot of additional possibilities. Don't hesitate to have a look at its help file.

### Combining rasters

We've already seen that you can combine different rasters in a multiband data raster, if they're properly aligned and have the same extent.

```{r}
layers <- c(landcover_layers[[1]], landcover_layers[[3]])
```

We can also combine the pixel values of different rasters, but again, they need to be perfectly aligned and have the same extent. For this kind of analyses, it is easier to imagine all the rasters as overlapping layers, and some function is then applied to all the overlapping pixels to generate one or several new layers. These analyses are often called local analyses since they consider each pixel value within a raster separately.

For example we can easily find the areas with either forests or settlements by summing the two rasters. If we'd like to give more weights to the forests, this is also possible. The `terra` package extends most arithmetic functions to support `SpatRaster` objects.

```{r}
settlements <- landcover_layers[[1]]
forests <- landcover_layers[[3]]

combn <- settlements + forests
combn2 <- settlements + 2 * forests
plot(combn2)
```

If you use multiband rasters, you can use the `app()` function to get the same result. You can also specify your own function. Note that the third example will produce a raster with 2 bands.

```{r}
combn3 <- app(layers, "sum")
combn4 <- app(layers, "max")
combn5 <- app(layers, function(i) {pi * sqrt(2 * i)})
```

Sometimes you'll need to combine 2 or more discrete rasters but you'll still want to be able to see the original categories in the output raster. You can use a simple trick to do that. First reclassify the first raster and use the following numbers as categories: 10, 20, 30, etc. Then reclassify the second raster, and use the following numbers as categories: 1, 2, 3, etc. After adding the two rasters, you'll know immediately that, for example, a value of 24 means that you're in an area within the second category of the first raster and fourth category of the second. If you have three rasters you simply need to use an higher order of magnitude for one of the rasters.

```{r}
reclMat_elev <- matrix(c(0, 500, 100, 500, 700, 200, 700, Inf, 300), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
elev_recl2 <- classify(elev, reclMat_elev, include.lowest = TRUE)
landcover_recl2 <- classify(landcover_resample, reclMat_landcover)
elev_land <- elev_recl2 + landcover_recl2
plot(as.factor(elev_land))
```

### Focal analysis

Until now we saw examples of global, zonal and local analyses with raster data. Now we're going to dive in the beautiful world of focal analyses. Note that people doing data science and mathematics will usually use the word convolution instead. Focal means that we're not only considering the pixel value, but also the values of the neighboring pixels. The neighborhood is called kernel or moving window and is usually a square (like a 3x3, the focal pixel and its 8 neighbors) or a circle. Once the neighborhood is defined, we perform an aggregation of the pixel values (e.g. by summing or averaging) within the neighborhood and store the output as the new value for the focal cell, and then we move the window to the next pixel. The following figure shows a example using a 3x3 moving window and the minimum as the aggregating function.

![](figures/04_focal_example.png)

Note that the output raster will usually be smaller than the original one (if the moving window is a $m$x$n$ matrix, the output will have $(m-1)$ less rows and $(n-1)$ less columns). If you want a raster with the same size as the original, you'll need to ignore the NA values, hence the window will be smaller in the margins of the raster.

In the next example we perform a smoothing of our DEM using a square moving window of size 21 (pixels) and the arithmetic mean as aggregating function. Note that the size of the moving window has to be an odd number.

```{r}
elev_focal_mean <- focal(elev, w = 21, fun = "mean")
elev_focal_mean2 <- focal(elev, w = 21, fun = "mean", na.rm = TRUE)
plot(c(elev, elev_focal_mean))
```

Focal analyses are really interesting to characterize the habitat of a site since you also get information about the neighboring areas. Using a discrete raster we can for example compute the number of forest pixels in the neighborhood of each pixel.

```{r}
forests_focal_sum <- focal(forests, 5, fun = "sum")
plot(c(forests, forests_focal_sum))
```

In R, moving windows are stored as matrices whose values represents the weights of the neighbors. Until now we only used moving windows where all pixels in the neighborhood had the same weight. It is thus possible to define your own kind of moving window. The shape (rectangle or circle) usually doesn't have a big influence but adjusting the weights allows all kind of different results (smoothing, sharpening, edge detection, etc.). The `terra` package provides the `focalMat()` function if you need to create specific windows. The first argument will be the raster on which the focal analysis will be computed, the second is the size of the moving window (in the units of the CRS, not in pixels), and then you can specify the type. By default `focalMat()` will produce a matrix whose values sum to 1, this means that using the sum with these weights as aggregating function will actually compute the arithmetic mean. If we really want to compute the sum, we need to adjust the weights ourselves and set all non-zero values to 1.

```{r}
(fwin_rect <- focalMat(forests, c(200, 200), type = "rectangle"))
fwin_rect[fwin_rect > 0] <- 1
forests_focal_sum2 <- focal(forests, fwin_rect, fun = "sum")
identical(values(forests_focal_sum), values(forests_focal_sum2))

(fwin_circle <- focalMat(forests, 200, type = "circle"))
fwin_circle[fwin_circle > 0] <- 1
forests_focal_sum3 <- focal(forests, fwin_circle, fun = "sum")
plot(c(forests_focal_sum, forests_focal_sum3))
```

With focal analyses, we can actually perform standard image processing tasks similar to the ones you would find in Photoshop. For example we can easily apply a Gaussian blur to an orthophoto (here we only use the red band). The weights of a Gaussian moving window are based on the bivariate normal distribution, and in this case the second argument of the `focalMat()` function is the standard deviation of the distribution.

```{r}
#| cache: true
ortho_red <- ortho[[1]]
fwin_gauss <- focalMat(ortho_red, 1, type = "Gauss")
ortho_red_focal <- focal(ortho_red, fwin_gauss, type = "sum")
plot(c(ortho_red, ortho_red_focal), col = grey.colors(256), legend = FALSE)
```

If you need to compute some typical indices used in landscape ecology within the moving window, then have a look at the `landscapemetrics` package.

### Generate raster covariates

The `terra` package is also really good at generating new covariates. For example you can use the `terrain()` function to compute terrain characteristics from elevation data. The available outputs are: slope, aspect, TPI, TRI, roughness and flow direction.

```{r}
slope <- terrain(elev, "slope", unit = "degrees")
aspect <- terrain(elev, "aspect", unit = "degrees")

plot(c(slope, aspect))
```

If we look at the lake of Sempach, we see that the `terrain()` function is using an aspect value of 90° for all flat areas.

Aspect can be a bit tricky to work with because it is circular (a value of 355 is very similar to a value of 5). You'll need to use circular statistics techniques to process it. Another solution that is often used is to decompose aspect in two orthogonal components: eastness and northness. Eastness is an index going from -1 to 1 representing the west-east component of aspect, while northness (also an index from -1 to 1) is representing the north-south component. To compute these values we use the sine and cosine functions on the aspect values, but these have to be in radians!

```{r}
aspect_rad <- terrain(elev, "aspect", unit = "radians")
eastness <- sin(aspect_rad)
northness <- cos(aspect_rad)

plot(c(eastness, northness))
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Use the slope raster to mask all the flat areas of the `eastness` raster. Use a value of 0 for these areas.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
flat_slope <- slope
flat_slope[flat_slope < 0.1] <- NA
eastness_corr <- mask(eastness, flat_slope, updatevalue = 0)
```
:::

We can also easily calculate distance rasters using the `distance()` function. In the next example, the value of each pixel in the output raster will be the distance to the nearest bird sighting. You can use this with other vector types, for example to compute the distance from streets or the distance to coastlines.

```{r}
dist_from_obs <- distance(elev, vect(obs))
plot(dist_from_obs)
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

What is the largest distance from a bird sighting within the municipality of Sempach?

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
obs_in_sempach <- obs[sempach,]
dist_sempach <- distance(elev, obs_in_sempach)
dist_sempach <- mask(dist_sempach, sempach)
global(dist_sempach, "max", na.rm = TRUE)
plot(trim(dist_sempach))
```
:::

### Rasterize vector data

Vector data provides a better precision but some operations can be really slow when using large data sets. Sometimes it can be interesting to convert your vector data sets to rasters. This will allow you to perform analyses that would have been to slow or even impossible using vectors.

You'll need the `rasterize()` function to perform such transformations. The second argument is a template raster data set that will be used to provide the extent and resolution. You also need to specify a single attribute that will be used. It is not possible to rasterize a vector data set to a multiband raster.

```{r}
muni_raster <- rasterize(vect(muni), elev, field = "popsize")
plot(muni_raster)
```

This rasterization process can also be used to aggregate vector data. In the next example we first create a template raster using the extent of Sempach and a resolution of 100 meters. Then we rasterize the sightings without specifying an attribute but using an aggregating function. Each pixel of the output raster will contain the number of sightings.

```{r}
r <- rast(sempach, resolution = 100)
nobs <- rasterize(vect(obs), r, fun = "sum")
nobs[is.na(nobs)] <- 0
plot(nobs)
```

### CRS transformations

Performing CRS transformations on vector data sets in relatively easy since you only have to transform the vertices. It is a bit more complex with raster data sets. Projecting a raster data involves a resampling, the geometric characteristics of your raster will change and the pixel values will be recomputed. If you have vector data in a specific CRS and rasters in another CRS but you want to use a common CRS, it's usually better to transform the vectors. Since the operation involves resampling we also need to define the interpolation function. As we've seen before, you need to be careful when projecting discrete rasters and use nearest neighbor interpolation.

```{r}
elev_wgs84 <- project(elev, "EPSG:4326", method = "bilinear")
landcover_wgs84 <- project(landcover, "EPSG:4326", method = "near")

plot(elev_wgs84)
```

If we have a look at some characteristics of the original and projected rasters, we see that some changes occurred...

```{r}
ncell(elev)
ncell(elev_wgs84)
dim(elev)
dim(elev_wgs84)
```

## Making maps

Since a few years, it is possible to make really attractive maps using only R. For example, almost of the maps of the Swiss Breeding Bird Atlas 2013-16 were produced in R. Standard GIS software will still provide more advanced cartographic tools but R will be powerful enough for most cases. Moreover you definitely have a big advantage in terms of reproducibility. In this part we will first look at how we can use `sf` and `terra` standard plotting functions to make simple maps. Then we'll use the package `tmap` which provides interesting tools to make more complex maps in a more or less intuitive way. In the end we'll have a look at how we can generate dynamic maps such as the ones you usually find on the web.

### Basic maps

As we've seen in some previous examples, the basic function to make maps is simply the `plot()` function. Both `sf` and `terra` extend this function to support vector and raster data sets. When we create maps, we usually consider the different data sets as layers that we combine to produce a nice output. This is why we will often use the `add = TRUE` argument in the `plot()` function. Most of the standard arguments provided by the standard `plot()` function (such as `pch`, `lwd`, `cex`, etc.) are also supported for `sf` objects. If you want to see all the additional parameters, you can check the help files (`?sf::plot` and `?terra::plot`). Here's a simple example:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(muni), col = "grey90", border = "grey50", lty = 3)
plot(st_union(muni), col = NA, border = "grey50", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)
plot(obs["name"], pch = 16, cex = 2, add = TRUE)
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Try a few options, try to change some colors, add some of the streets.
:::

When we have polygons with some continuous attribute, we can create what is called a choropleth map. These maps are often used to represent spatially variables like population densities or per-capita income.

```{r}
cantons <- st_read("data/geodata.gpkg", "cantons", quiet = TRUE)
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(cantons["popsize"])
plot(cantons["popsize"], nbreaks = 15)
plot(cantons["popsize"], breaks = "quantile")
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Compute the population density and plot the corresponding choropleth map. Find better values for the breaks and change the colors used.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
cantons$popdensity <- cantons$popsize / st_area(cantons)
cantons$popdensity <- units::set_units(cantons$popdensity, 1/km^2)
plot(cantons["popdensity"], breaks = "jenks", nbreaks = 10, pal = hcl.colors(10))
# Note: jenks usually generates breaks that produce good looking maps, but they're really hard to interpret...
```
:::

If you need good colors for your maps, you should use the `RColorBrewer` and `viridis` packages. These were designed by color specialists and are highly recommended. For `RColorBrewer` you can visualize the existing color palettes on the following website: <https://colorbrewer2.org>.

Plotting raster data is very similar

```{r}
plot(elev, breaks = 15, col = hcl.colors(15))
```

You need to be extra cautious when using data sets with different CRSs. Let's have a look at this example:

```{r}
temp_poly <- st_buffer(soi, 2000000)
plot(st_geometry(World))
plot(temp_poly, col = "grey90", add = TRUE)
plot(st_transform(temp_poly, 4326), col = "grey90", add = TRUE)
```

### Exporting high quality maps

Using the default R graphic device doesn't always produce good quality maps, especially if you need to use them for publications. If you want high quality maps you can use the PNG `cairo` graphic device. If you're producing maps containing orthophotos or topographic maps, you should use the JPEG cairo device instead.

```{r}
#| eval: false
png("export/map.png", width = 4200, height = 3000, res = 300, type = "cairo")
plot(st_geometry(muni), col = "grey90", border = "grey50", lty = 3)
plot(st_union(muni), col = NA, border = "grey50", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)
plot(obs["name"], pch = 16, cex = 2, add = TRUE)
dev.off()
```

When you include topographic maps or orthophotos in you maps, you might get disappointing results. By default, `terra` is using 500000 pixels to plot your map. If one of the layers has more pixels, `terra` will randomly sample them which can give the impression of a poor resolution. You can increase this number by using the `maxcell` argument. Be ready to wait a bit if you use really high values.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(ortho, maxcell = 10000)
plot(ortho, maxcell = 100000)
```

### Swiss map with hillshade

If you need a nice Swiss map, you can use the following data and code snippet. The data and the hillshade were produced by Swisstopo and you should add the copyright if you use them. Note how the hillshade is customized and how the rivers get larger.

```{r}
#| cache: true
# Import cartographic elements
lakes <- st_read("data/swiss_carto.gpkg", "lakes", quiet = TRUE)
rivers <- st_read("data/swiss_carto.gpkg", "rivers", quiet = TRUE)
border <- st_read("data/swiss_carto.gpkg", "border", quiet = TRUE)

# Define the width of the rivers which will be used on the maps (rescale the attribute "thickness" between 0.5 and 2)
riverswidth <- as.numeric(gsub("[^0-9.]", "", rivers$thickness))
width_std <- (riverswidth - min(riverswidth)) * (2 - 0.5) / (max(riverswidth) - min(riverswidth)) + 0.5

# Import the high-resolution hillshade (copyright swisstopo)
hillshade <- rast("data/hillshade.tif")
crs(hillshade) <- "EPSG:2056"
# Compute minmax values
setMinMax(hillshade)
# Generate classes for the display of the hillshade
mapBreaksHillshade <- seq(minmax(hillshade)["min",], minmax(hillshade)["max",], length.out = 64)
nbColsHillshade <- length(mapBreaksHillshade) - 1

# Crop the hillshade with the extent of Switzerland (add a small buffer to avoid clipping the map in some places)
hillshade <- crop(hillshade, ext(border) + 5000)

# Mask hillshade
hillshade <- mask(hillshade, border)

# Plot
plot(hillshade, breaks = mapBreaksHillshade, col = grey.colors(nbColsHillshade, start = 0.7, end = 0.99), mar = c(1, 1, 1, 1), axes = FALSE, legend = FALSE, maxcell = 1000000)
plot(st_geometry(border), col = NA, border = rgb(130, 130, 130, maxColorValue = 255), add = TRUE, lwd = 3)
plot(st_geometry(rivers), col = rgb(69, 138, 230, maxColorValue = 255), add = TRUE, lwd = width_std)
plot(st_geometry(lakes), col = rgb(162, 197, 243, maxColorValue = 255), border = rgb(69, 138, 230, maxColorValue = 255), add = TRUE)
```

### Static maps with tmap

If you want to make more complex maps, you can still achieve almost everything using standard plotting procedures but you'll spend a lot of time trying to hack everything. If you're a `ggplot2` user, you can of course use it with spatial data. However there's another package, `tmap`, that is similar to `ggplot2` but more intuitive for maps and more GIS friendly. The `tmap` package is also based on the grammar of graphics approach that separates data and aesthetics app.

#### Mapping layers

The `tmap` package is extremely powerful and allows making complex maps. However the number of options is really large and it is easy to feel a bit lost. Fortunately `tmap` also provides the `qtm()` function for quick mapping with sensible defaults.

```{r}
qtm(muni)
```

For more complex maps you will use the `tm_shape()` function which will tell `tmap` which data sets you want to use, then you use other functions that will process the data sets as layers (e.g. `tm_polygons()`, `tm_dots()`) and tell `tmap` how to represent them. An example should make things a bit clearer.

```{r}
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons() + tm_dots(size = 2) + tm_text("name", ymod = 1, col = "navy") 
```

If you want to combine different data sets, you need to use `tm_shape()` twice.

```{r}
tm_shape(muni) + tm_borders() + tm_shape(obs) + tm_dots(size = 0.2, col = "navy")
```

One nice feature of the package is that you can save map objects and modify them later

```{r}
map1 <- tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons()
map1 + tm_dots(size = 2) + tm_text("name", ymod = 1, col = "navy")
```

```{r}
tm_shape(sempach) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(obs) + tm_dots()
```

By default, `tmap` is using the first `tmap_shape()` function to define the extent of the map. It is called the "master" shape. If you need to define your extent using another layer, you can add the `is.master = TRUE` argument to the desired `tmap_shape()` function.

```{r}
tm_shape(sempach) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(obs) + tm_dots()
tm_shape(sempach) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(obs, is.master = TRUE) + tm_dots()
```

We're not limited to vector data, `tmap` can easily plot `SpatRaster` objects (and also rasters coming from the `stars` package). We just need to combine `tm_shape()` with `tm_raster()` or `tm_rgb()` if you have RGB multiband raster. Internally `tmap` is using the `stars` package to process rasters, so there an internal conversion is happening for `SpatRaster` objects. By default rasters will be classified, if you want a continuous map, you can add the `style = "cont"` argument to the `tm_raster()` function. If you have a large raster, `tmap` will downsample it to gain speed. If you need the full resolution, you can add `raster.downsample = FALSE` to the `tm_shape()` function. You can of course combine vector and raster data.

```{r}
tm_shape(elev) + tm_raster()
tm_shape(elev) + tm_raster(style = "cont")
tm_shape(ortho) + tm_rgb()
tm_shape(ortho, raster.downsample = FALSE) + tm_rgb()
```

The position of the legend for the DEM map is not so nice. Moving it around in the map will not help us since the raster is covering the whole map. We thus need to put the legend outside of the map. To do that we need the `tm_layout()` function. It allows you to modify all the layout elements used in your maps.

```{r}
tm_shape(elev) + tm_raster(style = "cont") + tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE)
```

#### Choropleth maps

Producing a choropleth map is extremely easy with `tmap`. You just need to specify the attribute name inside the `tm_polygons()` function. The legend is automatically added. Changing the classification method is also possible.

```{r}
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons("popsize")
```

You can easily map several attributes in the same plotting window. In the next example we also use the `tm_layout()` function to add a title and change the position of the legend.

```{r}
muni$area <- st_area(muni)
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons(c("popsize", "area")) + tm_layout(title = c("Population size", "Area"),
                                                               legend.position = c("left", "bottom"),
                                                               title.position=c("right", "top"))
```

The next example is not a choropleth map, but it shows you another way to plot a continuous variable on a map.

```{r}
tm_shape(muni) + tm_borders() + tm_bubbles("popsize", scale = 2)
```

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## Exercise (5 minutes)

Try to make a choropleth map of population size combined with `tm_bubbles`. What is happening with the legend? Try to give a different title to both legends.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-fold: true
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons("popsize", title = "Population size (colors)") +
                 tm_bubbles("popsize", scale = 2, title.size = "Population size (circles)")
```
:::

The default color palettes used by `tmap` are not always appropriate. As we've seen earlier, the `RColorBrewer` and `viridis` packages provide really good color palettes. The `tmaptools` package provides a nice function to visualize them: `palette_explorer()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
tmaptools::palette_explorer()
```

Let's try to change the color palette. You can easily reverse the color palette by putting a `-` in front of the palette name.

```{r}
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons("popsize", palette = "viridis", style = "quantile",
                             title = "Population size", border.col = "white", lwd = 0.5)
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons("popsize", palette = "-viridis", style = "quantile",
                             title = "Population size", border.col = "white", lwd = 0.5)
```

#### Customizing layout

We can include extra objects in our map, such as scale bars or north arrows. Each element has a `position` argument. In the next example we also include some styling using the `tm_style()` function. Currently 8 styles are available (have a look at the help file).

```{r}
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons("popsize", palette = "viridis", style = "quantile",
                             title = "Population size", border.col = "white", lwd = 0.5) + 
                 tm_compass(position = c("right", "bottom")) +
                 tm_scale_bar(position = c("left", "bottom")) +
                 tm_style("grey") +
                 tm_layout(main.title = c("Population size around Sempach"),
                           legend.position = c("right", "top"))
```

If you need to plot a world map with a legend, you can use the `tm_format(World)` or `tm_format(World_wide)` function to improve the format of the map. Here we also use the equal earth projection.

```{r}
tm_shape(st_transform(World, 8857)) + tm_polygons("area") + tm_style("natural") + tm_format("World_wide")
```

Having multiple maps on the same plot can be achieved using the `tmap_arrange()` function. First create your maps and store them in a `tmap` object, then use them with `tmap_arrange()`.

```{r}
map1 <- tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons()
map2 <- tm_shape(sempach) + tm_polygons() + tm_shape(obs_in_sempach) + tm_dots()
map3 <- tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons("popsize")

tmap_arrange(map1, map2, map3, nrow = 1)
```

If you need multiple maps with a common legend, you should use the `tm_facets()` function. In the next example we first generate a fake continuous attribute and then automatically create separate maps for each bird species, using the new attribute for the legend.

```{r}
obs$var1 <- runif(nrow(obs), 1, 100)
tm_shape(obs) + tm_symbols(col = "var1") + tm_facets(by = "name")
```

#### Saving maps

Saving maps is trivially easy using the `tmap_save()` function. The format is automatically recognized using the file name extension. You can also specify the height, width and resolution of the map.

```{r}
#| eval: false
map1 <- tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons()
tmap_save(map1, "mymap.png")
```

### Dynamic maps

The `tmap` package is not only amazing for static maps, you can also produce dynamic maps such the ones you find on the web. You need to switch the `tmap`mode using `tmap_mode("view")`. If you want to produce static maps, you can switch back to the standard mode using `tmap_mode("plot")`. Most of the functions and parameters are also available for dynamic maps. Note that the data is automatically projected to the Web Mercator projection.

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons("popsize", palette = "viridis", style = "quantile",
                             title = "Population size", border.col = "white", lwd = 0.5)
```

If you plot two maps side by side, they'll be synchronized.

```{r}
tm_shape(muni) + tm_polygons(c("popsize", "area"), palette = "Oranges")
```

If you need other background maps, you can use the `tm_basemap()` function. It is even possible to use the Swiss topographic maps or the orthophotos provided by Swisstopo.

```{r}
ext <- st_bbox(c(xmin = 8.05, xmax = 8.55, ymin = 46.875, ymax = 47.125), crs = st_crs(4326))
tm_shape(soi) + tm_dots(col = "red", size = 1) +
  tm_basemap("https://wmts.geo.admin.ch/1.0.0/ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-grau/default/current/3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpeg") +
  tm_view(bbox = ext)
```

If you need the Swiss topographic map with colors, use the following URL: https://wmts.geo.admin.ch/1.0.0/ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe/default/current/3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpeg

If you need the orthophotos, use the following URL: https://wmts.geo.admin.ch/1.0.0/ch.swisstopo.swissimage/default/current/3857/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpeg

The `tmap` package is sometimes too complex for simple visualizations. You can also use the `mapview` package which is really efficient for large data sets.

```{r}
library(mapview)
mapview(muni)
```

You can also easily plot multiple data sets using a list.

```{r}
mapview(list(muni, obs))
```

And producing choropleth maps is also possible. You need to specify the attributes using the `zcol` argument.

```{r}
mapview(muni, zcol = "popsize")
```

The `mapview` package can also plot raster data sets, but you need to convert them to stars objects first. Transparency is also possible.

```{r}
elev_stars <- stars::st_as_stars(elev)
mapview(elev_stars, alpha.regions = 0.5)
```

## Using QGIS through R

Sometimes you know how to do things in QGIS and you don't have the time to search how to do it in R, or maybe QGIS is faster for a specific task. A recent R package called `qgisprocess` was developed for this reason. It gives access to the whole Processing toolbox available in QGIS. Currently it is only available on GitHub and not yet on CRAN, but you can use the `install_github()` function provided by the `remotes` package to install it. Of course you need to have QGIS installed as well.

```{r}
#| eval: false
remotes::install_github("paleolimbot/qgisprocess")
```

To use it, you first need to run the `qgis_configure()` function so that the package can look for a QGIS installation. If you have several versions of QGIS installed, you can use `options(qgisprocess.path = "path/to/qgis_process")` or set the `R_QGISPROCESS_PATH` environment variable.

```{r}
#| echo: false
options(qgisprocess.path = "/Applications/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/qgis_process")
```

```{r}
library(qgisprocess)
qgis_configure()
```

You can easily list all the available algorithms using the `qgis_algorithms()` function. For example let's compute a simple buffer around our sightings. The package will convert the `sf` object to a format understood by QGIS, then QGIS will compute the buffer and produce a GeoPackage with the output. We can then import it back to an `sf` object.

```{r}
obs_buff_qgis_res <- qgis_run_algorithm("native:buffer", 
                                        INPUT = obs,
                                        DISTANCE = 1000,
                                        DISSOLVE = TRUE,
                                        .quiet = TRUE)
obs_buff_qgis_res
obs_buff_qgis <- st_read(qgis_output(obs_buff_qgis_res, "OUTPUT"), quiet = TRUE)
plot(st_geometry(obs_buff_qgis))
```

To check the name of the function parameters, you can access the QGIS help files through R using the `qgis_show_help()` function.

## Getting data

Here's a non-exhaustive list of packages you can use to download GIS data.

| Package name | Description |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| osmdata | Download and import small OpenStreetMap datasets |
| osmextract | Download and import large OpenStreetMap datasets |
| geodata | Download and import imports administrative, elevation, WorldClim data |
| rnaturalearth | Access to Natural Earth vector and raster data |
| rnoaa | Imports National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) climate data |
| elevatr | Import digital elevation models |
| giscoR | Tools to download data from the GISCO (Geographic Information System of the Commission) Eurostat database |
| MODIStsp | Download MODIS satellite data |
| swissgd | Download data from the Swiss geodata infrastructure (https://github.com/zumbov2/swissgd) |

## More help

If you need more help, documentation, code examples, you should have a look at the `sf` vignettes and the `terra` documentation (<https://rspatial.org>).

The book "Geocomputation with R" is absolutely amazing and available for free (legally) on the web: <https://r.geocompx.org>. If you really like `tmap`, you should also check the `tmap` book that is also available for free on the web (but is not yet finished): <https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap-book>. If you don't really like `tmap` you can also have a look at the `mapsf` package.
